This repository contains the final project for ENG 220 Group 12 (Finance), consisting of Mya Pacheco (PM), Judith Solis, Dulcinea Lopez, Nadia Fuentes, and Abby Wouters.


Abstract: 

This project explores global financial disparity and long-term economic trends using the Global Economy Indicators dataset, which spans 51 years of national data. 
Our goal is to analyze the disparity of Gross National Income (GNI) per capita between countries and highlight trends in how the relative strength of currency 
and economic growth has changed over time. Learning these trends will lead us to identify which areas suffer with persistent economic disparity and which countries 
have gained notably in living standards. By studying the way GNI is distributed and the trends in currency we aim to show the ways that there are both widening and 
narrowing gaps between countries, providing a more distinct view of global economic balance. The dataset that was chosen is excellent for this project because it 
provides consistent economic indicators, spanning over five decades, among many countries which allow for meaningful comparative analysis. The results of this study 
can be utilized by policymakers, economists, and those investing capital to encourage equitable growth in global development and more data-aided financial decisions. 

Dataset: Global Economy Indicators (Also in repository)


Team Contributions:
Dulcinea (1):
Judith (2): Will write Python code to analyze the Gross National Income (GNI) across countries and identify trends in GNI growth over the last 50, 25, 10, and 5 years. 
The data will be divided into 5 year intervals, with each interval representing the average GNI during that period. This will help reveal which continents are experiencing increases or decreases in their GNI, as well as the rate of change over time. Finally, I will plot the results as a histogram to visualize how quickly the GNI has changed over time across different continents. 
Mya (3):
Nadia (4):
Abby (5): In charge of graphs showing the ordering of countries' GNI and exchange rates over the last 50, 25, 10, 5 years. Also, will visualize overall data related to GNI and exchange rates based on inital analysis done by Judith and Mya.

Everyone will write documentation and part of the report related to their code. Additionally, everyone will upload their code to GitHub and do the part of the video related to their code.
